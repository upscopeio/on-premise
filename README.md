# on-premise
On premise distribution of Upscope

## Installation and quick start
Requirements:
- MongoDB
- Redis

1. Download Upscope from https://dist.upscope.io/index.html with the username and password provided
2. Run the server by running `BYPASS_AUTH=yes ./upscope-data-[macos|linux|windows.exe]` depending on your platform
3. Add the following code to any HTML page:
```
(function(w, u, d){if(typeof u!=="function"){var i=function(){i.c(arguments)};i.q=[];i.c=function(args){i.q.push(args)};
w.Upscope=i;var l = function(){var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;
s.src='http://localhost:5002/upscope.js';var x=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s,x);};l();}}
)(window, window.Upscope, document);

Upscope('init', {
apiKey: 'onpremise'
});

Upscope('getWatchLink', console.log);
```

## Authenticating API requests
To perform a REST request to the API, you'll need to set the `Authorization` header to `Bearer REST_KEY`, with `REST_KEY` being
the `REST_KEY` set as an environment variable (in production) or `upscope123` (in development).

## Authenticating the agent
Unless `BYPASS_AUTH` is set to `yes`, agents will be redirect to `AUTH_ENDPOINT` with the ID of the visitor they intend
to screen share with as a query parameter.

Your server will need to authenticate the agent and use the following endpoint to generate a signed url to initiate
screen sharing.

```
POST /api/users/:visitor_id/watch_url
{
  "agent": {
    "id": "unique_agent_identifier",
    "name": "Name of the agent"
  }
}
```

A successful request will return a JSON response like this:
```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "url": "http://localhost:5002/screen?id=123&token=abc.def"
}
```
Redirecting the agent to `url` will initiate the screen share.

### Authenticating the agent in production
To ensure correct billing and usage tracking, you'll need to get an authorization token from our server to start a session in production mode. To do this, you'll need to use your cloud [REST API key](https://app.upscope.io/settings/teams/_/api).

Before making the request to the on-premise endpoint, grab the token by making a request to:
```
POST https://api.upscope.io/v1.1/onpremise/token
{
  "agent": {
    "id": "unique_agent_identifier",
    "name": "Name of the agent"
  },
  "visitor_id": "the visitor_id of the user"
}
```

A successful request will return a JSON response like this:
```
{
  "authorized": true,
  "token": "asoidjfoaisjdf..."
}
```
You would then add this token as a `licenseToken` parameter to the `POST /api/users/:visitor_id/watch_url` request.


## Retrieving information about users
You can retrieve information about a user by making a `GET` request to the following endpoint:
```
GET /api/users/:visitor_id
```

You can retrieve a list of the most recent users:
```
GET /api/users/list/latest?apiKey=abc
```
with `apiKey` being the key used as api_key in the javascript configuration for that user.

You can retrieve information about a user by making a `GET` request to the following endpoint:
```
GET /api/users/list/search?q=search_query&apiKey=abc
```
with `apiKey` being the key used as api_key in the javascript configuration for that user, and `q` being the search query.

## Tracking usage
By setting `REPORT_USAGE_ENDPOINT` to a custom URL you are able to track usage information.

Upscope will make `POST` requests to the endpoint at the start, end and every 60 seconds during each screen share. The
content will be a json encoded document which looks like this:
```
{
  session_id: "abc", // id of the session provided when generating the watch link
  seconds: 60, // number of seconds since last report
  ended: false, // true if screen share has ended
  features_used: [], // Array of features used
  agent_id: "id of the agent",
  not_authorized: false, // Set to true if the user never authorized the session
  went_live: true // Set to true if screen sharing has started (as opposed to being stuck in "loading"
}
```

**NB: In case multiple agents screen share with the same user, and there is an overlap, usage will be sent for both
agents separately.**

## Use in production
To use Upscope in production you will need a license key. This will ensure the server accepts more than a few connections
for development.

## Configuration options
The following options are available through env vars:

| Variable name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | The current environment | `development` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | A secret key to encrypt JWTs generated by the app. It should be secure and only known to the server. It can be changed at any time without repercussions. | `lazycat` (only configurable in production) |
| `LICENSE_KEY` | Your server license key. | `null` (required in production) |
| `REST_KEY` | The API key you will use to interact with the REST API | `upscope123` (only configurable in production) |
| `MONGO_URI` | Mongo connection URI | `mongodb://localhost:27017/upscope` (set to an empty string to not use mongo in development mode) |
| `REDIS_URI` | Redis connection URI | `redis://localhost:6379` |
| `REPORT_USAGE_ENDPOINT` | A url you use to keep track of your Upscope usage | `null` |
| `HIDE_IP_ADDRESS_FROM_AGENT` | If set to `yes` no IP address will be shown to agents | `no` |
| `HIDE_URL_FROM_AGENT` | If set to `yes` no visitor url will be shown to agents | `no` |
| `CUSTOM_AGENT_CSS` | Url to a CSS file to be included in the agent screen | `null` |
| `BYPASS_AUTH` | If set to `yes` agents will be redirected to the screen share without authentication | `no` |
| `PORT` | Port to run Upscope on | `5002` |
| `BASE_ENDPOINT` | Endpoint where Upscope server is running | `http://localhost:` + `PORT` |
| `HOMEPAGE` | Url to redirect agents to when they hit the `BASE_ENDPOINT` | `null` |
| `AUTH_ENDPOINT` | Url to redirect agents to when they follow the watch link for authentication | `null` |
| `THROTTLE_STATUS` | If set to `off` incoming connections will not be throttled | `on` |
| `DEBUG_COLLECTION_STATUS` | If set to `off` no debug info will be stored | `on` |
